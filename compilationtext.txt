hi friends 

i havent yet figured out the particulars of makefiles for C++ but i put together a basic test program and linked the compilation such that it seemingly works?

my computer doesnt make sound currently (lol) so if one of you could test and mess around with this 

g++ -g -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 wavegen.cpp $testpath/source/generator/Generator.cpp $testpath/source/generator/SineGenerator.cpp $testpath/tools/TextPlot.cpp

where $testpath ==  [your path]/synthesizer/aquila-src/aquila
