A project to create a CLI/TUI oscillator-based synth.

ADDED IN THIS VERSION:
- soundgen_sine: an attempt at mushing together aquila and RtAudio

TODO for gui:
	keyboard should immediately change frequency
	button for play/pause
	preset buttons for wave shape - square, sine, etc
	samples -> rtaudio!
