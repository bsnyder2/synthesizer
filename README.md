# Synthesizer
Ben Snyder, Joshua Bowen, Emerson Rosen-Jones

## TODO
### UI
- Ignore below for UI- follow layout.txt

- Simple on-screen keyboard
    - Octave should update whenever octave key is pressed
    - C through F
- Other displays:
    - Current note (X#)
        - Octave should only update when next note is played
    - Amplitude (%, meter on right of wave window)
    - Frequency (Hz)
    - Current waveshape selected
- Info pane on key press

### Synthesis
- Triangle wave preset

### Larger goals
- Play/pause button
- Draw one wave period with keyboard, set as waveshape
- Arpeggiator
- Waveform antialiasing
- Normalize amplitudes for waveshapes -> same perceived volume
- Polyphony - additive synthesis
