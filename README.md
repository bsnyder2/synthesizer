# synthsh: the subtractive synthesizer for your terminal window

## Features
- Control amplitude and frequency
- Choose from 4 wave shapes
- Waveform visualizer
- A piano keyboard


### Next goal
- MIDI input for piano keyboard
- Arpeggiator + hold
    - shift to start hold. then we have an array of semitones values. e.g. [0, 4, 7] for major triad on C4
    - then can also set arp speed.
    - tempo setting
    - Draw one wave period with keyboard, set as waveshape
    - Polyphony - additive synthesis
    - Waveform antialiasing
    - Normalize amplitudes for waveshapes -> same perceived volume
